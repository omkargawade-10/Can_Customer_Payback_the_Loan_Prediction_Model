# Can_Customer_Payback_the_Loan_Prediction_Model
Building a model, whether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan?

# Business Problem
Building a Predictive Model so as to suggest that the borrower will pay back their loan.

# Overview
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

# Our Goal
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.
